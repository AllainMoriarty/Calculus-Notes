# 📚 Section 1.1: Velocity and Distance

> **Calculus begins with motion**—the link between how far you’ve gone and how fast you’re going.

## 🚗 The Core Idea: Two Instruments, Two Functions
- **Odometer**: measures total distance traveled → call this **f(t)**  
- **Speedometer**: measures instantaneous velocity → call this **v(t)**  
**Units**:  
- f(t) = miles (or km)  
- v(t) = miles per hour (or km/h) → includes **time** in the unit  
> **Central Question of Calculus**:  
> Can you find **v** if you know **f**?  
> Can you find **f** if you know **v**?  
✅ **Yes!**  
- **Differentiation**: go from **f → v** (find velocity from distance)  
- **Integration**: go from **v → f** (find distance from velocity)

## 📉 Constant Velocity: The Simplest Case
Suppose **v = 60 mph** (constant).  
Then distance after **t** hours:  
f(t) = 60t  
✅ **Key observations**:  
- Graph of **f(t)** is a **straight line** (linear growth)  
- Graph of **v(t)** is a **horizontal line** at 60  
- **Slope of f(t) = velocity**  
  slope = (change in distance) / (change in time) = Δf / Δt = v  
### What if the car doesn’t start at zero?
- f(t) = 20 + 60t → starts 20 miles away  
  → **slope still 60** (the "+20" cancels in Δf)  
### What if velocity is negative?
- v = -30 mph → car moves backward  
- f(t) = -30t → distance **decreases**  
- Slope = -30 → **negative velocity**  
> 📌 Speedometers usually show **speed** (absolute value), not velocity.  
> But **calculus uses velocity** (with sign).

## 🔁 Slope vs. Area: The Two Sides of Calculus
### 1. **From f to v → SLOPE**  
The **velocity v(t)** is the **slope** of the distance graph **f(t)**.  
### 2. **From v to f → AREA**  
The **distance f(t)** is the **area under the velocity graph**.  
✅ **Why?**  
- If v = 60 for t = 2 hours → area = rectangle = 60 × 2 = 120 miles  
- This is **integration**: summing up little pieces of (velocity × time)  
> **Fundamental Insight**:  
> **Slope** (differentiation) and **Area** (integration) are opposites.

## 🔄 Example: Forward and Back
- **0 ≤ t ≤ 3**: v = +V → car moves forward  
  → f(t) = V·t → at t=3, f = 3V  
- **3 ≤ t ≤ 6**: v = -V → car moves backward  
  → f(t) = V·(6 - t) → at t=6, f = 0  
### What the graphs show:
- **v-graph**: rectangle above axis (0–3), rectangle below axis (3–6)  
- **Total area** = (V×3) + (-V×3) = **0** → back to start  
- **f-graph**: rises linearly to 3V, then falls linearly to 0  
> 📌 **Area below time axis = negative distance** (backward motion)

## 🧠 Functions: The Language of Calculus
A **function** is a rule that assigns **one output** to **each input**.  
- **v(t)** = velocity at time t → "v of t"  
- **f(t)** = distance at time t → "f of t"  
### Domain and Range:
- **Domain**: set of allowed inputs (e.g., 0 ≤ t ≤ 6)  
- **Range**: set of possible outputs  
  - For v(t): {+V, -V}  
  - For f(t): {0 ≤ f ≤ 3V}  
### Important Notes:
- A function **cannot have two outputs** for one input.  
- **f(t) is continuous** (no jumps) → even if v(t) jumps!  
- **v(t) can be discontinuous** (e.g., sudden stop/start)

## 🛠️ Transforming Functions
You can create new functions from old ones:  
| Transformation      | Effect on Graph                     | Example (if f(t) = 2t + 1) |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **f(t) - 2**        | Move graph **down** by 2            | 2t + 1 - 2 = 2t - 1        |
| **f(t - 2)**        | Move graph **right** by 2           | 2(t - 2) + 1 = 2t - 3      |
| **2·f(t)**          | Stretch **vertically** by 2         | 2·(2t + 1) = 4t + 2        |
| **f(2t)**           | **Speed up** time (compress horizontally) | 2·(2t) + 1 = 4t + 1    |  
✅ **Slope changes**:  
- Vertical stretch → slope ×2  
- Horizontal compression (f(2t)) → slope ×2

| **Negative v**      | Moving backward → f(t) decreases                                        |
| **Total distance**  | Net area (positive + negative) under v(t)                               |
| **Function**        | Rule: input t → output f(t); must be single-valued                      |
| **Transformations** | Shift, stretch, compress → change graph and slope                       |
